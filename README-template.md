## My process

The HTML was made using the semantic structure, following the project structure, the CSS was made following the HTML document, from the main component for the components within it, finishing with the active states from the elements. The JavaScript was made in the most simple way, for the simplicity of the project, using the onclick event and the code for changing the style in Js for both hide and show the answers, for both the buttons and the paragraphs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
